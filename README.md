# seek

seek is a small search engine for java based on [Redis](http://github.com/antirez/redis "Redis").

it uses [Jedis](http://github.com/xetorthio/jedis "Jedis") as a client for Redis

## How do I configure seek?
    List<JedisShardInfo> shards = new ArrayList<JedisShardInfo>();
    shards.add(new JedisShardInfo("localhost"));
    Config config = new Config();
    Seek.configure(config, shards);

## How do I index my data?

    Seek seek = new Seek();
    Index index = seek.index("items");
    Entry entry = index.add(id);
    entry.addField("category_id", "MLA31594");
    entry.addField("seller_id", "84689862");
    entry.addTag("buy_it_now");
    entry.addText("title",
            "Apple Ipod Classic 160gb 160 8Â° Generation 40.000 Songs!");
    entry.addOrder("start_date", 1287278020);
    entry.shardBy("seller_id");
    entry.save();    

## How do I search?

    Seek seek = new Seek();
    Search search = seek.search("items", "start_date", new ShardField("seller_id", "84689862"));
    search.field("category_id", "MLA31594", "MLA39056");
    search.tag("buy_it_now", "promotion");
    search.text("title", "ipod 160");
    Result result = search.run(cache, start, end, Search.Order.DESC);

## Can I get general Facets for the shard?

    Seek seek = new Seek();
    Info info = seek.getInfo("items", new ShardField("seller_id", "84689862"));

## Downloads

You can download the latests build at: 
    http://github.com/xetorthio/seek/downloads

For more usage examples check the tests.

## I want to contribute!

That is great! Just fork the project in github. Create a topic branch, write some tests and the feature that you wish to contribute.

To run the tests:

- Use the latest redis master branch.

- Run a instance of redis

- mvn test

Thanks for helping!
